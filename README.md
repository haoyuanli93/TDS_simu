# TDS_simu
This repo tries to implement the calculation described in the thesis
[X-RAY THERMAL DIFFUSE SCATTERING AND ITS STUDIES OF LATTICE DYNAMICS](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/4827061.pdf)

## Calculation Plan
This is the calculation structure plan

1. Use numba+numpy+cpu to simulate each diffraction pattern.
2. Use mpi4py to simulate different diffraction patterns.
